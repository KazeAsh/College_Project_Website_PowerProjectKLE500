PowerProject KLE550 Cordless Tool Series

The PowerProject Tool company is known for its variety of corded and cordless power tools,
ranging anywhere from a standard power drills and circular saws to lawn and gardening tools.  
The KLE550 series of tools adds a new line of tools to the company’s well-known reputation for 
quality and affordable power tools. The KLE550 series includes a new 45V lithium ion-powered 
leaf blower, lawn mower, pole saw, hedge trimmer, weed eater, chainsaw, and mulcher. 45V lithium 
ion batteries are new to the industry and could revolutionize the battery life and mobility of traditional 
gas-powered and electric tools.

The KLE550-series tool, 45V lithium ion batteries currently work with the KLE550 series only. This means that 
the batteries aren't interchangeable with PowerProject's standard line of battery-operated tools. Additional 
battery packs and charging stations are available for purchase through the KLE550 series.

Features:

4–8 hours of battery life: Depending on the tool in the series, the 45V battery yields 4 to 8 hours of continuous 
use.

Powerful motors: The motors in the KLE550 series are comparable to corded electric counterparts in the 
company’s corded power tool series.

Safety: All KLE550-series power tools come with a safety switch that prevents the tool from turning on 
once the battery is installed. This feature saves battery life and protects the user.

Warranty: Each tool in the KLE550 series comes with a one-year warranty and an extended warranty option.
